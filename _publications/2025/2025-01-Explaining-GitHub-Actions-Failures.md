abstract: >-
  GitHub Actions (GA) has become the de facto tool for automating software workflows, including
  building, testing, and deploying code. However, when GA fails, diagnosing errors is often
  challenging due to long, complex, and unstructured logs. This study explores the potential of
  large language models (LLMs) to generate correct, clear, concise, and actionable contextual
  descriptions of GA failures, focusing on developers’ perceptions of their feasibility and
  usefulness. Our results show that over 80% of developers rated LLM-generated explanations
  positively for simpler logs, suggesting that LLMs can assist in understanding common GA errors
  and potentially reduce manual analysis. At the same time, our findings indicate that improved
  reasoning capabilities are needed to support more complex CI/CD scenarios, particularly for
  experienced developers who prefer concise summaries over detailed explanations.
