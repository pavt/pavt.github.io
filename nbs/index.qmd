## ðŸ’¼ Pablo Valenzuela

I'm Pablo Valenzuela, a researcher pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Bern, Switzerland. I also teach computer science at the University of La Frontera in Chile. My research interests lie in software engineering, empirical software engineering, mining software repositories, and software maintenance and evolution.

In my current research, I am particularly interested in exploring how data-driven approaches can enhance DevOps practices, especially in optimizing software development processes and maintaining large-scale software systems. For more details on my work in this area, you can review my publications, where I discuss these topics in depth.
